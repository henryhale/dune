# Text-to-Command Classification Model Development

## 1. **Define Your Command Taxonomy**

Create a comprehensive list of all possible commands your model should recognize. Start with 10-20 commands and expand as needed. Document examples for each.

## 2. **Data Collection & Labeling**

Gather or generate text samples for each command class. For a starting point, you can:

- Write examples manually (100-500 per class)
- Use data augmentation (paraphrasing, synonym replacement)
- Crowdsource if building at scale
  Ensure balanced class distribution to avoid bias.

## 3. **Data Preprocessing**

- Normalize text (lowercase, remove extra whitespace)
- Handle special characters and punctuation
- Remove stop words (optionalâ€”keep if they're semantically important)
- Tokenize appropriately for your model

## 4. **Train/Test/Validation Split**

Split data: typically 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test. Use stratified splitting to maintain class balance.

## 5. **Choose Your Model**

Options ranked by simplicity to complexity:

- **Naive Bayes + TF-IDF** (fast baseline, interpretable)
- **Logistic Regression + embeddings** (lightweight, good baseline)
- **Random Forest/SVM** (good performance, faster than deep learning)
- **Fine-tuned BERT/DistilBERT** (state-of-the-art, requires GPU)
- **LLM-based** (GPT via API, lowest effort but highest cost)

## 6. **Feature Engineering**

- TF-IDF vectors for traditional ML
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) for neural models
- Pre-trained embeddings (BERT, sentence-transformers) for modern approaches

## 7. **Train the Model**

Use your chosen framework (scikit-learn, PyTorch, Hugging Face). Start simple, iterate.

## 8. **Evaluate & Iterate**

Check precision, recall, F1-score per class. Use confusion matrix to identify weak areas. Try:

- Different hyperparameters
- Different architectures
- More training data for problematic classes
- Class weights if imbalanced

## 9. **Handle Edge Cases**

Test ambiguous inputs ("what's my network settings?"). Decide if you need an "UNKNOWN" class or confidence thresholds.

## 10. **Deploy**

Package as API/service. Monitor performance and collect misclassified examples to retrain periodically.

**Quick start:** Build a TF-IDF + Logistic Regression baseline first (takes hours), then upgrade to BERT if needed.
